It can produce ASCII art if you have easy-graph installed.

Call it with ~C-u M-x epwgraph-show~ if you want to specify a regular expression of nodes to focus on or nodes to ignore.
Only the inputs and outputs connected to a focus node will be shown (including upstream and downstream).
Excluded nodes will be ignored.

Keybindings:

| ~g~ | refresh                  |
| ~d~ | disconnect               |
| ~c~ | connect                  |
| ~C~ | connect specific channel |

Set ~epwgraph-combine-channels~ to nil if you prefer to see separate channels.
