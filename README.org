~epwgraph-show~ shows the graph of Pipewire audio connections inside Emacs. Logical connections between some nodes (ex: playback and monitor) are also shown. You'll need graphviz to visualize the connections as SVG and/or easy-graph (libgraph-easy-perl) to visualize the connections as ASCII.

Call it with ~C-u M-x epwgraph-show~ if you want to specify a regular expression of nodes to focus on or nodes to ignore.
Only the inputs and outputs connected to a focus node will be shown (including upstream and downstream).
Excluded nodes will be ignored.

Keybindings:

| ~g~ | refresh                                                           |
| ~d~ | disconnect logical nodes                                          |
| ~D~ | disconnect specific ports                                         |
| ~c~ | connect logical nodes                                             |
| ~C~ | connect specific ports                                            |
| ~t~ | toggle between showing specific ports and combining logical nodes |
